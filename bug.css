The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, when using `calc()` with percentages, unexpected behavior can occur if the parent container's dimensions are not defined correctly.  For example, if you try to calculate the width of an element as 50% - 10px, and the parent container doesn't have its width explicitly set (e.g., `width: 500px;`), the calculation might yield incorrect results because the percentage calculation needs the parent's dimensions to work correctly.
